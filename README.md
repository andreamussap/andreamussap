## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Writer :books: :pencil2: and Data Analyst :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: enthusiast -

> _Anytime you use your phone, look up something online, stream music, shop with a credit card, post on social media, or use GPS to map a route, you're creating data. A digital world and the millions of smart devices inside of it have made the amount of data available truly mind-blowing. (Google Data Analytics Certificate)_

I'm a driven and curious person, learning new tools and technologies motivates me, and I aim to apply these learnings to my job.

## Volunteering

I like to volunteer with both technical and non-technical projects. There are many advantages of being a volunteer: contribute your knowledge and learn from peers, give back to the community, having purpose and feeling valued.

The following are some of the projects which I participate:

* [Hacktoberfest](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hacktoberfest-2020-main-takeaway-andrea-mussap/)
* [TED Translator](https://www.ted.com/profiles/2458319/translator)
* [Parkrun IE](https://www.parkrun.ie/)
