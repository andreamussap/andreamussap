## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Writer :books: :pencil2: and Data Analyst :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: enthusiast. This quote from [Piyanka Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyanka/) summarizes why I'm interested in learning data analysis -

> Everybody needs data literacy because data is everywhere. Itâ€™s the new currency, it's the language of the business. We need to be able to speak that.

I'm a driven and curious ðŸ’¡ ðŸ”Ž person, so learning new tools and technologies motivates me, and I aim to apply these learnings to my daily routine.
